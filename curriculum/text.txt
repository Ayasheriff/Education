 “Curriculum” is a term that refers to the courses of study offered or planned by an educational institution or program.
 It can also include the learning experiences, skills, attitudes, and values that pupils are expected to acquire from schooling.
 Curriculum can be organized in different ways, such as by subject, grade, or sequence, and can vary across classrooms, schools, districts, states, or countries.

 “Scientific subjects rely solely on memorization and indoctrination.”
مشكلة
Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. The method rests on the premise that the recall of repeated material becomes faster the more one repeats it.
 Some of the alternatives to rote learning include meaningful learning, associative learning, spaced repetition and active learning.

Rote learning is widely used in the mastery of foundational knowledge. Examples of school topics where rote learning is frequently used include phonics in reading,
 the periodic table in chemistry, multiplication tables in mathematics, anatomy in medicine, cases or statutes in law, basic formulas in any science, etc. 
By definition, rote learning eschews comprehension, so by itself it is an ineffective tool in mastering any complex subject at an advanced level.
 For instance, one illustration of rote learning can be observed in preparing quickly for exams, a technique which may be colloquially referred to as “cramming”.
حل 
One way to address the issue of scientific subjects relying solely on memorization and indoctrination is to incorporate other methods of learning that promote understanding and critical thinking.
 Some alternatives to rote learning include meaningful learning, associative learning, spaced repetition and active learning. 
These methods can help students understand the material on a deeper level and apply their knowledge to new situations.

Teachers can also use a variety of teaching techniques such as inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning to
 engage students in the learning process and encourage them to think critically about the material. Additionally, incorporating hands-on activities and experiments can help students see the practical applications of the material and improve their understanding.
Meaningful learning is a type of learning that involves understanding how all the pieces of an entire concept fit together.
 The knowledge gained through meaningful learning applies to new learning situations and stays with students for life. Meaningful learning is active, constructive, and long-lasting, and allows students to be fully engaged in the learning process.

Inquiry-based learning is a teaching method that involves guiding students to ask questions and investigate a topic to discover new information. This method encourages students to take an active role in their own learning and promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Incorporating hands-on activities in teaching can help students see the practical applications of the material and improve their understanding. For example, in a science class, students can conduct experiments to see scientific concepts in action. In a math class, students can use manipulatives to visualize mathematical concepts. Hands-on activities can also be used in other subjects such as history, language arts, and social studies to engage students in the learning process.

“Curricula rely solely on the theoretical aspect and not on the practical aspect.”

One way to address this issue is to incorporate more hands-on activities and practical experiences into the curriculum. This can help students see the real-world applications of the material and improve their understanding. For example, in a science class, students can conduct experiments to see scientific concepts in action. In a math class, students can use manipulatives to visualize mathematical concepts. Hands-on activities can also be used in other subjects such as history, language arts, and social studies to engage students in the learning process.

In addition to hands-on activities, teachers can also use teaching methods such as inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning to engage students in the learning process and encourage them to think critically about the material. These methods promote active learning and help students apply their knowledge to new situations.
حل
Another way to address the issue of curricula relying solely on the theoretical aspect and not on the practical aspect is to incorporate more real-world examples and case studies into the curriculum. This can help students see the practical applications of the material and improve their understanding. For example, in a history class, students can analyze primary sources to better understand historical events. In a language arts class, students can read and analyze literature from different cultures and time periods to improve their understanding of the material.

Teachers can also use teaching methods such as inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning to engage students in the learning process and encourage them to think critically about the material. These methods promote active learning and help students apply their knowledge to new situations.

“Curricula are not suitable for continuous scientific development.”

One way to address this issue is to regularly update and revise curricula to keep up with the latest developments in science and technology. This can involve incorporating new research findings, theories, and technologies into the curriculum. Teachers can also attend professional development workshops and conferences to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field.

In addition to updating the curriculum, teachers can also use teaching methods that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This can help students learn how to adapt to new information and apply their knowledge to new situations. For example, inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning are all teaching methods that encourage students to think critically about the material and apply their knowledge to new situations.

//“The clear gap between curricula and labor market requirements.”

One way to address this issue is to align curricula with the skills and knowledge that are in demand in the labor market. This can involve conducting regular surveys and consultations with employers to identify the skills and knowledge that are most valued in the workforce. Curricula can then be revised to incorporate these skills and knowledge, and to provide students with practical experiences that prepare them for the workforce.

In addition to aligning curricula with labor market requirements, schools can also provide students with opportunities to gain practical experience through internships, co-op programs, and job shadowing. These experiences can help students apply their knowledge in real-world settings and develop the skills that are valued by employers.
// The issue of the clear gap between curricula and labor market requirements is a significant challenge facing many education systems. This gap can result in students graduating without the skills and knowledge that are in demand in the workforce, making it difficult for them to find employment.

The translation of the sentence to English is: "The financial return is very low, which makes the teacher resort to private lessons."

One issue that can arise when teachers do not receive adequate financial compensation for their work is that they may feel undervalued and demotivated. This can result in teachers seeking additional sources of income, such as private tutoring, to supplement their income. This can lead to teachers being overworked and unable to devote their full attention and energy to their students in the classroom.

One way to address this issue is to ensure that teachers receive fair and adequate compensation for their work. This can involve increasing teacher salaries and providing additional benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. Schools can also provide opportunities for career advancement and professional growth, which can help teachers feel valued and motivated.

In addition to improving teacher compensation, schools can also work to reduce the workload of teachers by providing them with adequate support and resources. This can involve hiring additional staff to assist with administrative tasks, providing teachers with planning time, and reducing class sizes to allow teachers to provide more individualized attention to their students.
