            <p>
                <h2>“Curriculum”</h2>
                is a term that refers to the courses of study offered or planned by an educational institution or program.
                It can also include the learning experiences, skills, attitudes, and values that pupils are expected to acquire from schooling.
                Curriculum can be organized in different ways, such as by subject, grade, or sequence, and can vary across classrooms, schools, districts, states, or countries.

                   <h2> “Scientific subjects rely solely on memorization and indoctrination.”</h2>
                    Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. The method rests on the premise that the recall of repeated material becomes faster the more one repeats it.
                     Some of the alternatives to rote learning include meaningful learning, associative learning, spaced repetition and active learning.
                     Rote learning is widely used in the mastery of foundational knowledge. Examples of school topics where rote learning is frequently used include phonics in reading,
 the periodic table in chemistry, multiplication tables in mathematics, anatomy in medicine, cases or statutes in law, basic formulas in any science, etc. 
By definition, rote learning eschews comprehension, so by itself it is an ineffective tool in mastering any complex subject at an advanced level.
 For instance, one illustration of rote learning can be observed in preparing quickly for exams, a technique which may be colloquially referred to as “cramming”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>So how we solve the issue ?</h2>
                    One way to address the issue of scientific subjects relying solely on memorization and indoctrination is to incorporate other methods of learning that promote understanding and critical thinking.
 Some alternatives to rote learning include meaningful learning, associative learning, spaced repetition and active learning. 
These methods can help students understand the material on a deeper level and apply their knowledge to new situations.

Teachers can also use a variety of teaching techniques such as inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning to
 engage students in the learning process and encourage them to think critically about the material. Additionally, incorporating hands-on activities and experiments can help students see the practical applications of the material and improve their understanding.
Meaningful learning is a type of learning that involves understanding how all the pieces of an entire concept fit together.
 The knowledge gained through meaningful learning applies to new learning situations and stays with students for life. Meaningful learning is active, constructive, and long-lasting, and allows students to be fully engaged in the learning process.

                        <h2>“Curricula rely solely on the theoretical aspect and not on the practical aspect.”</h2>
                        
    One way to address this issue is to incorporate more hands-on activities and practical experiences into the curriculum. This can help students see the real-world applications of the material and improve their understanding. For example, in a science class, students can conduct experiments to see scientific concepts in action. In a math class, students can use manipulatives to visualize mathematical concepts. Hands-on activities can also be used in other subjects such as history, language arts, and social studies to engage students in the learning process.
    
    In addition to hands-on activities, teachers can also use teaching methods such as inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning to engage students in the learning process and encourage them to think critically about the material. These methods promote active learning and help students apply their knowledge to new situations.

                        <h2>And here how we will solve this!</h2>
                        Another way to address the issue of curricula relying solely on the theoretical aspect and not on the practical aspect is to incorporate more real-world examples and case studies into the curriculum. This can help students see the practical applications of the material and improve their understanding. For example, in a history class, students can analyze primary sources to better understand historical events. In a language arts class, students can read and analyze literature from different cultures and time periods to improve their understanding of the material.
    
    Teachers can also use teaching methods such as inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning to engage students in the learning process and encourage them to think critically about the material. These methods promote active learning and help students apply their knowledge to new situations.

                    <h2>“Curricula are not suitable for continuous scientific development.”</h2>
                    One way to address this issue is to regularly update and revise curricula to keep up with the latest developments in science and technology. This can involve incorporating new research findings, theories, and technologies into the curriculum. Teachers can also attend professional development workshops and conferences to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field.
    
    In addition to updating the curriculum, teachers can also use teaching methods that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This can help students learn how to adapt to new information and apply their knowledge to new situations. For example, inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning are all teaching methods that encourage students to think critically about the material and apply their knowledge to new situations.

                    <h2>“The teacher is not properly qualified educationally and pedagogically.”</h2>
                    The issue of teacher qualifications in education and pedagogy is a complex oneHighly qualified and competent teachers are fundamental for equitable and effective education systems1. Teachers today are facing higher and more complex expectations to help students reach their full potential and become valuable members of 21st century society1. National systems employ qualifications frameworks and professional standards as a reference to guide teachers on what they should know and be able to do.
                    Teachers must be professionals who make decisions based on a robust and updated knowledge base1. This knowledge base includes pedagogical knowledge, which is the knowledge of teaching and learning1. National systems employ qualifications frameworks and professional standards as a reference to guide teachers on what they should know and be able to do1. These frameworks and standards define and shape teachers’ professional competences.

                <p>
                    <h2>What do you think is the solution ?</h2>
                    One way to address the issue of unqualified teachers is to avoid corruption and nepotism in employment processes1. Another way is to de-emphasize factors such as gender representation or similar matters in selecting quality teachers, and instead focus on qualifications1.
    
    In low-income countries, providing quality learning and teaching materials (LTM) can help compensate for disabling factors such as large class sizes, poorly trained or unqualified teachers, a shortage of instructional time, high levels of illiteracy among parents, and a lack of reading materials in homes.

                    <h2>"The financial return is very low, which makes the teacher resort to private lessons."</h2>
                    One issue that can arise when teachers do not receive adequate financial compensation for their work is that they may feel undervalued and demotivated. This can result in teachers seeking additional sources of income, such as private tutoring, to supplement their income. This can lead to teachers being overworked and unable to devote their full attention and energy to their students in the classroom.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Lets solve this </h2>
                    One way to address this issue is to ensure that teachers receive fair and adequate compensation for their work. This can involve increasing teacher salaries and providing additional benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. Schools can also provide opportunities for career advancement and professional growth, which can help teachers feel valued and motivated.
    
    In addition to improving teacher compensation, schools can also work to reduce the workload of teachers by providing them with adequate support and resources. This can involve hiring additional staff to assist with administrative tasks, providing teachers with planning time, and reducing class sizes to allow teachers to provide more individualized attention to their students.
