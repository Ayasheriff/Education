        <h2 class="title">MEE</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, 
            such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. 
            These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. 
            Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral 
            definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, 
            but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. 
            Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, 
            educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, 
            empathy, and complex vocational skills.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. 
            Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, 
            and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly 
            divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition 
            or alternative to formal education. It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, 
            and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal education occurs 
            in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered 
            educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly 
            informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings. For instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal 
            or informal, depending upon the structure.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. 
            The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of different philosophies, 
            theories and empirical research agendas.
            There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' 
            lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. 
            A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] For example, 24 January is the International 
            Day of Education. At UN - level, several observance years and decades have been dedicated to education, 
            such as 1970 International Education Year.[5] Education is also one of the 17 Global Goals, where global initiatives 
            aim at achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all
