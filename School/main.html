        <h2>Among the problems of education are problems in schools, such as:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Weakness of material resources:</li>
            <p>Education requires significant financial support for the success of educational institutions, 
                and some Arab countries may lack this. Teachers’ low wages, the inability to support students through scholarships,
                and the preparation of laboratories and libraries, all lead to poor learning outcomes.</p>
            <li>Not using technology:</li>
            <p>Because of the lack of financial capabilities, technology has become neglected in schools,
                and because of teachers' lack of awareness of the need to use technology in the era we live in today. 
                And the adoption of old education systems made technology a marginalized element in education, which affects the level of students.</p>
            <li>Prevalence of violence in schools:</li>
            <p>The phenomenon of violence in the Arab world is not only spread in schools, but is also found in the streets, 
                homes and transportation. Therefore, the student finds violence everywhere. 
                It is worse for the student to find violence in the place where he learns and from his teachers who are supposed to be his role models and ideals. 
                Because of this, education in the Arab world produces distorted personalities who hate education and school and become resentful of the society in which they live</p>

                <img src="../images/violence2.jpg" alt="violence" width="250px" height="250px">
            <li>Exams:</li>
            <p>This problem is related to exams, including not focusing on important skills and relying on closed questions, and they waste a lot of time, in addition to a lot of money. Examinations make students hate school more, and the examination system confines the learning process to testing only, which encourages cheating.</p>
            <img src="../images/ex.jpg" alt="violence" width="250px" height="250px">
            <li>Traditional curriculum:</li>
            <p>Curricula are constantly evolving at the global level, according to the era in which we live, and teaching methods, 
                presentation methods and specializations vary. However, the problems of education in the Arab world is that it still adheres to old curricula that do not serve our current age. 
                Which affects the professional level of students. To graduate and be shocked by reality because of the requirements of the labor market that they were not trained in, 
                and the specializations that they did not know and that the educational authorities did not care about.</p>
            <li>Conservation Reliance:</li>
            <p>Curricula that are stacked and full of stuffing and complexity. Where it measures the level of memorization of students and not the level of understanding and thinking. 
                It is concerned with developing the skill aspects of students and encouraging them to experiment, discover, develop creativity, intelligence, logical thinking and problem-solving.</p>
            <img src="../images/images.jpg" alt="">
            <li>Low morale:</li>
            <p>Because of all of the above, students and teachers become apathetic and do not seek to provide the best. Because they do not find encouragement from educational institutions. Because of the low rate of salaries for teachers, the miscalculation of outstanding students, and the lack of interest in the educational process, the morale of all members of the educational institution decreases.</p>
            <img src="../images/1_617468.jpg" alt="" height="250px" width="400px">
            <li>Bad management:</li>
            <p>Education in the Arab world lacks a wise administration that succeeds in hiring qualified and specialists in the field of education, which is the opposite of what happens in terms of hiring non-specialists. It also needs to train workers on how to plan, organize, manage, deal with students, and conduct the education process in a positive and successful manner.</p>
            <img src="../images/school1.jpg" width="250px" height="250px">
            <img src="../images/school2.jpg"  width="250px" height="250px">
            <li>Missing goals:</li>
            <p>The goals of education are lost between the student, the teacher and the principal in the Arab world. And with it, the success of the educational process is lost, because there is no clear goal. There is no specific plan that everyone recognizes and strives to achieve. Rather, the matter proceeds randomly and in a boring traditional way without goals that generate determination and will.</p>
            <li>The low quality of Arab education</li>
            <p>The weakness of the skills and abilities that education creates in the personality and mind of the student. Arab education used to teach the student to read, write and some mathematical operations, while teaching it a general culture influenced by the past more than the present. And to visit us and start with her students, and start the relationship of her students.</p>
            <li>Standardization of Arab education:</li>
            <p>Arab education continues to teach the same educational programs, whether in secondary or university education, given that basic education is very similar and unified. However, the problem lies in secondary and university education, as secondary education during the past half century does not deviate from the branches of arts and sciences. As for the Arab universities, the scientific departments are almost the same in every university or college, as they are repetitive and double. These academic divisions may be commensurate with the reality of Arab society in the past. Now there is a need to create various divisions and divisions in secondary and university education to suit the needs of social, technological and economic development.</p>
            <li>Unavailability of the school environment:</li>
            <p>It does not have an appropriate school environment with the basic needs necessary for the success of the educational process, whether that is related to buildings, classroom and school laboratory equipment, or opportunities for free expression of opinions. Freedom of initiative, action and thinking in devising solutions to existing problems at the level of educational departmentsIt does not have an appropriate school environment with the basic needs necessary for the success of the educational process, whether that is related to buildings, classroom and school laboratory equipment, or opportunities for free expression of opinions. Freedom of initiative, action and thinking in devising solutions to existing problems at the level of educational departments.</p>
            <li>High prevalence of illiteracy:</li>
            <p>Illiteracy is widespread, whether it is literacy or technological illiteracy. Despite the many efforts exerted to combat illiteracy and the huge amounts of money spent on it on an annual basis, some Arab countries still suffer from their inability to eradicate illiteracy effectively and comprehensively. </p>

    <div class="reasons">
        <h2>Among the reasons for the emergence of educational problems in schools:</h3>

        <div class="one">
            <h3>Boredom and boredom</h3>
            <span>One of the studies indicates that most of the times of boredom that students spend are in some classes, which leads to negative responses towards learning.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
            <h3>Small lab area(Physics - Chemistry Lab)</h3>
            <span>Where all respondents reported that it needs expansion in addition to its urgent need for equipment (Furniture + materials) for laboratories to facilitate the educational process.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="three">
            <h3>Aggression</h3>
            <span>The inability to control the students and teach them the correct behaviors before teaching, so they feel apathy in the lessons, so they beat, bully, exchange insults, tear books, and destroy chairs and school property.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="four">
            <h3>Distraction from loud sounds</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="five">
            <h3>Frustration and stress</h3>
            <span>It occurs because of the large number of laws and restrictions set by the teacher, which leads to students' confusion and caution in dealing, just as the teacher's speed in explaining lessons without giving students the rest to think, participate and comprehend leads to their frustration with lack of understanding.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="six">
            <h3>uncomfortable:</h3>
            <span>-The respondents reported, at a rate of 65%, high temperatures and humidity in the educational and administrative spaces, especially
                In the summer, this can be attributed to poor ventilation and the high numbers of students in the classroom.
                <br>-Lack of calmness in the classroom environment.
                <br>-The high number of students per semester due to the inability to accommodate the number of students.
            </span>
