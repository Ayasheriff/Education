            <p class="subtitle">
                There are few careers that make a bigger impact than teaching. Teachers are shaping the next generation, 
                those that will decide what the future looks like.
                But this noble work doesn’t come without challenges. Many teachers face challenges both inside and outside of the classroom,
                 often making the career feel overwhelming. 
                While the rewards often outweigh the negatives, it's still important to understand the daily challenges teachers face. 
                It can help parents and administrators better support teachers and help teachers know that they are not alone in their struggles.

        <h2 class="communicate">Common challenges teachers are facing in the classroom:</h2>
        <div>
            
            <p>These are ten of the most common challenges that teachers face on a day-to-day basis. 
                While that may seem like a lot of bad news, once the issue is understood, it’s easier to find the solution. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>1. Understanding different learning styles</h3>
        <p>A single classroom most often contains students with a wide set of learning abilities and styles. It is nearly impossible for teachers to simply use one teaching method
             and have it be effective for all of their learners
        </p><p>
        </p><h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Teachers are required to think strategically when making lesson plans to cater to all the learning styles in their classroom.
             They also have to be flexible while actively teaching, as they make adjustments in real
             time based on student performance.
            This can take a lot of time and effort on the teacher’s end, but the benefits for student performance are unbeatable.
        </p>
        
       <div class="video-text">
       <di>
         <h3>2. Lack of effective communication </h3>
         <p>Teachers can also face significant challenges when trying to communicate with their students effectively. Not every student, 
            especially at lower grade levels, will know when to ask for help. 
            For example, most high school students are able to effectively communicate their needs, struggles,
             and triumphs. However, teachers with younger grade levels may not have the same experience.
            In cases like this.</p>
            <h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
            <p>teachers have to find an effective channel of communication so that their classroom can function well.
            Now, there’s not one answer to this problem. Teachers may need to use different strategies depending on the age of their students.
             Particularly for teachers that teach multiple grades, this can be a time-consuming task. 
            Finding a system to improve communication in the class can not only help struggling students get support,
             but it can also help teachers manage multiple students' needs at once.
            See below how once teacher implemented a non-verbal signalling system in her classroom that helped students express their needs
             and thoughts without disrupting the class.</p>
       </di>
       <div>
        <video class="video" width="470" height="300" controls="">
            <source src="/images//teacher-toolkit-nonverbal-signals.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        </div>
       </div>
       <div class="video-text">
        <div>
            <h3>3. Staying up to date with learning technology</h3>
            <p>Learning technology is constantly changing. Every year, there are a slew of new apps, websites, 
                    and other technology tools created to improve the learning process.
                    And there is a lot of pressure on teachers to constantly stay up to date with the latest technology. 
                    Most believe that the latest and greatest tools will provide the best quality education. 
                    But there is often a lack of funding, resources, or time to implement every new technology as it's introduced.
            </p>
            <h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                Creating engaging lesson plans that also align with the state’s outlined curriculum can be a tall task. 
            And beyond just being engaging, time-constraints can also be an issue. While there is a syllabus and course schedule 
            to stick to, students will often need additional time to fully grasp a subject.
            Oftentimes, the state will outline a detailed curriculum for the school year, giving a jam-packed schedule for all 
            the topics that need to be covered in a particular year. Teachers need to rely 
            heavily on problem-solving skills in order to maximize their time in the classroom.
            Additionally, with larger class sizes, it can be difficult to ensure every student is getting the support they need to fully 
            understand a lesson. Teachers may work incredibly hard to create a great lesson plan that just doesn’t resonate with all of their students.
            </p>
        </div>
       </div>
        <h3>4. Communicating with parents</h3>
        <p>One of the most common and pressing classroom challenges for teachers is the fact that some students are not receiving adequate support outside of the classroom. </p>
        <h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
        <p> While teachers can work with students while they’re at school, students need support from their parents as well.
                    When parents take an active part in their children's learning, that student is much more likely to succeed.
                    This issue also extends to intrapersonal relationships. Students will often feel comfortable turning to a teacher in their time of need–when it’s
                     emotional support they are looking for instead of academic support.
                    However, this dynamic can put a lot of pressure on a teacher. The relationship can be tricky to navigate,
                     and teachers often don’t have enough hours in the day to check in and talk with every student. 
                    Students need to be fully supported both in school and at home in order to have the best chance of success.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Pressure from school administrators</h3>
        <p>Teachers are often under a lot of pressure by their school administrators to come up with new teaching strategies and
             ways in which they can improve student learning. 
            School administrators want to remain competitive with other school districts when it comes to performance and test scores. 
            However, teachers are the ones actually in the classroom, teaching students the necessary skills to achieve these outcomes. 
            Teachers are seen as exclusively responsible for student achievement, growth indicators, professional development, and discipline.
            With so much on a teacher’s plate, a supportive school administration can make a world of a difference to both their
            success and students’ success.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Lack of Parent Involvement  </h3>
        <p>Parents often think that as soon as their child starts to attend school, 
            their duty as educators finishes. They couldn’t be more wrong because education starts at home. 
            When parents step away from their child’s education thinking that teachers can handle it all, the quality of learning goes down.
        </p>
        <h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
        <p>Teachers should find ways to build rapport with the parents of their students. 
            They can send weekly classroom updates, daily conduct reports, or monthly handouts to keep parents in the loop. 
            They can also schedule conferences with parents to discuss and review their child’s progress throughout the year.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Behavior and classroom management </h3>
        <p>Student behavior can be difficult for teachers to manage on top of their other job tasks like administrative work, 
            staying on track with the curriculum, and staying up to date with the most recent classroom trends.</p>
            <h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
            <p>
            Creating distinct behavioral and academic plans can help teachers stay on track and meet their educational goals
             as the school year progresses. But this doesn’t happen without a lot of work and support from administrators, parents,
              and other educational professionals. 
            Oftentimes, motivating students with engaging lessons can be enough to manage student behavior in the classroom. 
            But in some cases, students may need more support to manage behavioral issues and create a growth mindset.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Time-consuming administrative work </h3>
        <p>The administrative work that comes with teaching takes a lot of time on top of managing students,
             creating assessments, and actually teaching lessons. Because of this, time management is a vital skill for every teacher.
            The overwhelming amount of administrative work on a teacher’s plate can adversely affect their work-life
             balance, as they are often required to spend time outside of working hours grading assignments, creating lesson plans,
              filling out reports, and more.
            In order to get everything done, some teachers are faced with the question of whether to give up their personal time or
             their time with students to complete administrative work. While they’re always looking for ways to streamline their
              administrative work, there often seems to be no good answer.
        </p>
      <div class="video-text">
        <div>
            <h3>9. Lack of funding</h3>
            <p>It's no secret that teachers and schools are constantly facing issues in terms of lack of funding.
                For most public schools across the country that run into issues with funding, teachers are the ones that are expected to
                 get creative and make do with the resources that they do have.
                Beyond just a lack of classroom materials, underfunding can also lead to the inability to hire enough teachers. 
                Oftentimes, this is remedied by increasing class sizes.</p>
                <h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
               <p> While it may seem like the only solution, large class size can negatively impact the classroom experience for many students.
                 It leaves less time for individualized teaching and one-on-one time with the teacher. 
                This can lower the quality of learning and have a negative impact on student learning. It also negatively impacts the teachers, 
                with them always feeling behind and overworked.
            </p>
           </div>
            <div>
                <video class="video" width="470" height="300" controls="">
                    <source src="/images/this-school-is-so-understaffed-the-principal-drives-the-bus.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                </div>
      </div>
        <h3>10. Burnout</h3>
        <p>Teaching is one of the most demanding professions out there. Teachers are constantly working to juggle all their tasks of
             educating students, managing behavior, completing administrative tasks, and more.
            And there’s an emotional element, as they know that their work is shaping lives and the future. <br>
            With the high demand from all their job responsibilities, teachers commonly experience burnout. Some of the common symptoms of
             burnout include:<br>
            -Feeling drained after working on lesson plans<br>
            -Dreading going to work<br>
            -Lacking the motivation to be productive<br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
        <p>Teachers should try to have the best work-life balance as possible in order to avoid burnout, but this can prove difficult
             with so many responsibilities on their plate. Administrators and parents need to take an active role in education in order
              to help prevent teacher burnout.
        </p>
        <h3>11.Low Student Participation</h3>
        <p>Usually, there are fewer quiet students than talkative and hyperactive students in a class. 
            This can be a tough thing to deal with for teachers who like to keep their classroom time interactive and high-energy. 
            Such behavior usually stems from low self-esteem or shyness because the students think they are not good enough.
        </p>
        <h3 class="solution">Solution:</h3>
        <p>One way to build confidence is to help them find something they are interested in and build upon it. 
            Teachers should not be too hard on the students when correcting them academically.
        </p>
