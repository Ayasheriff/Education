    <p class="title2"><b><em>Self-Education: Learn the Tips and Importance of Educating Yourself</em></b></p>
    <p class="title">Why is self-education important?</p>
    <img src="../images/write-notes-from-laptop-1.jpg">
    <p class="head">1. Self-education helps you think out-of-the-box.</p>
    <p>Here, you have the liberty to learn or educate yourself on any topic you want. Conventional methods of education limit the curricula to certain aspects or standardized subjects, confining your thought process within a restricted perimeter. But, self-education lets you learn and ponder anything you want. And, when you study a catalog of topics, your thought process gets configured to a boundless limit.</p>
    <p class="head">2. Do-It-Yourself Education (DIY)</p>
    <p>You choose the subject. You collect the materials. You set your own schedule and frequency. You test your potential. You declare the results.</p>
    <p class="head">3. Self-education = Optimism.</p>
    <p>It makes you an optimistic person because you will have more referrals. To simplify this, we would like you to think of it in this way: “If they can do it, I can do it too!”</p>
    <p class="head">4. Maintain pace with advances.</p>
    <p>Not only does self-education help you gain diverse knowledge, it will also help you maintain pace with the advances in the world.</p>
    <p class="head">5. You will create more opportunities for yourself</p>
    <p>By self-educating, you will know more things. You will possess the necessary knowledge to help you grow, and will also feel better knowing that you have grown in a way you’ve never done before.</p>
       <p> Now that you have seen how important it is, we are certain that you are inclined to pursue self-education and become a ‘knowledgeably’ supreme!</p>

    <!--1-->
    <p class="head">1. Set up your environment.</p>
    
    <p>Ambiance plays a great role in boosting motivation and maintaining dedication towards your goals.</p>
        <img src="../images/240_F_194389405_Y5mKz6pcaQf3xXRk7jvMhBVh6kWDOo2n.jpg" class="photo">
    <p> Hence, prepare a study environment that is free from cacophonies and is not cluttered.<p> Since you will not be learning in a classroom, it is important that you have a room in which you will do nothing but study.</p><p> Make sure the room is equipped with a comfortable seating arrangement like a desk and a chair, laptop or other study gadgets like iPad or desktop, books, notebooks for note-making and other required stationeries, and a stable internet connection.</p></p>
    

    <!--2-->
    <p class="head">2. Set your goals.</p>

    <p>Set your goals. Make sure your goals are realistic and they align with your long-term future plans.Note down your study goals in a crystal-clear manner and pin them on the wall right so that it is always in front of you.</p>
        <img src="../images/OIP (15).jpeg"class="photo">
    <p>  This will help you be consistent with meeting them and not getting deviated from them. <p>If it helps, you can break down your long-term goals into short ones as they will help you accomplish them in a comprehensive manner.</p></p>
    <br>

    <!--3-->
    <p class="head">3. Prepare and stick to a study schedule.</p>
    
    <p>You do not have to study from 10-7 or 6-11 at the night. You can study according to your convenience.</p>
         <img src="../images/ae12d862619bb71bcb61f5e78f581d49.jpg"class="photo">
    <p> But make sure that you stick to your schedule. You can follow study methods like 55-5 and others.<p> If you need some help with managing your time or remember when you are supposed to follow your learning session, you can always use a tool like Google Calendar to properly schedule your day-to-day activities and make sure nothing important overlaps with your personal study time.</p></p>
    

    <!--4-->
    <p class="head">4. Finding an online learning group.</p>


    <p>Learning with peers on online platforms can be a fun task.</p>
    <img src="../images/carousel_banner_online.svg"class="photo">
    
    <p>It helps build a study-like atmosphere, fights with isolation thoughts and aloofness, and can be a lot more beneficial than you can imagine.</p><p> The key to keeping up with your learning process might be making accounting yourself accountable to others.</p>
   <br><br>
    <p>Learning a new skill with a friend, family member or even a member of a popular online group can really help you stick to your goal and make a lot more progress. It will enable you to communicate with others and learn from their individual experiences. You can also collect various tips and tricks to make your learning journey easier.</p>
    

    <!--5-->
    <p class="head">5. Being your own inspiration.</p>
    
    
    <p>It is all about how disciplined and consistent you are throughout the entire process. Remember, learning is not linear. There will be demotivating factors or negative thoughts. You have to fight them off yourself. You can do so by:</p>
    <ol>

        <img src="../images/50.jpeg" class="photo">
        <li><p>Following short drills</p></li>
        <li><p>Taking ample breaks and sleep</p></li>
        <li><p>Exercising and meditating</p></li>
        <li><p>Learning to channel your inner thoughts.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <!--6-->
    <p class="head">6. Learn and Execute.</p>

    <p>Now that you have learned a whole different skill, it’s time to apply it and earn rewards.</p>
    <img src="../images/OIP (17).jpeg" class="photo">
    <p>Even after learning something, you need to make sure that you are able to use it in a number of situations and that no matter what happens, you will not forget it. The best way to go about this is by using this new skill in every situation you can.</p>

    <p>Most teachers are bent on getting their students to read more.<p> Reading is one of the most basic skills that students need to be successful at school and in their careers.</p><p> Furthermore, reading provides immense benefits for the young and old alike such as increased cognitive function and overall better brain health, makes us empathetic and feel connected to the world around us, builds better vocabulary and understanding, reduces stress and anxiety, and even improves the quality of our sleep. </p> <p> it can be an uphill task to get your young students hooked on to reading books, especially in this era of social media and instant gratifications. Having said that, here are a few steps which a teacher can take in order to develop a strong and healthy reading habit in his students.</p> <br>
    <p class="title">the Reason for the Student’s Disinterest in Reading </p><br>
    <img src="../images/OIP (9).jpeg">
    <p>Not every student will find reading enjoyable by itself. Maybe he feels like reading is a burden or he might find reading difficult. It is also possible that he finds it boring or he just hasn’t found the right material to read yet. With increased access to technology and the rise of online teaching we have witnessed, many students might also prefer reading on the screen rather than through books. </p>

    <p class="head">VISITING LIBRARIANS</p>
    <p>Librarians in your area, be they from a public or academic library, would likely love to help you .<br><br><p>
        School librarians have always had a role to play in promoting literacy—especially through reading for pleasure—and because of this, it’s often linked to the English department. This is not something that should be dismissed. As we know, students who read widely do better academically, as it introduces them to lots more vocabulary and also supports and engages their imagination.  </p>
    
    <p class="head">Librarians help you by </p>
    <img src="../images/librarian.png"class="photo">
    <p class="yellow">Book recommendations:</p> 
    <p>Try to suggest books that would fit well with the age and interests of the class. Display books on the current topic you’re teaching.</p>
    <p class="yellow">Informal book reviews: </p>
    <p>Encourage students to share what they’re reading. Maybe they’re reading a book for another class. Ask them to give their opinions about the book to their peers. Respectfully challenge them if their thoughts are ill-defined (e.g., “What makes the characters strong or weak?” or “How could the author have made the conflict more interesting?”).</p>
    <p class="yellow"> Reading tips: </p>
    <p>like speaking with high school students about how cell phones can distract us while reading, and I recommended turning them off when opening a book. Little suggestions like that can help students at least think about ways of becoming better readers.</p>

This approach ensures they are actively engaged in learning and encourages more complex thought processes.
